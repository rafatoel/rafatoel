## 🛰️ WELCOME TO THE LAB

🚀 You’ve just entered the **Rafatoel Cyber Lab** – a domain where offensive security research, red team simulations, AI automation, and ethical malware testing are fused together to defend the future.

This lab is designed to **simulate real-world attacks in a controlled, government-approved environment** and build counter-defense mechanisms using cutting-edge techniques. Every tool, PoC, and script here serves one purpose: **train stronger defenses by replicating the adversary.**

## 👤 ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m **Rafatoel** — Red Team Engineer, Automation Architect, and Cyberwarfare Simulation Specialist.

🔬 I lead ethical hacking research projects at an official national lab where I:

- Replicate malware attack vectors for defensive tool evaluation
- Automate browser, mobile, and desktop interactions at scale
- Build stealthy Android RATs, keyloggers, and AV-evasion modules
- Simulate C2 infrastructures and phishing pages for detection hardening
- Train AI-based systems for advanced threat modeling

💡 My philosophy: *You can't defend what you don't understand.*

🧠 I explore:

- Malware reverse engineering  
- Telegram/WhatsApp attack surfaces  
- Deep Android exploitation  
- AI-assisted red teaming (with GPT, LangChain, LLMOps)  
- Multi-device TikTok & social automation farms  
- Multi-objective AI in public service simulations (e.g. Bus Route Optimization using DRL + Transformers)
