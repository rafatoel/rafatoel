## 🧭 About Me

I'm **Rafatoel**, a developer and ethical hacker operating at the intersection of **security, automation, AI, and education**. My mission is to **simulate digital threats**, **build countermeasures**, and **empower others with cutting-edge tools**.

> 💬 “Most of my work is **classified or confidential**, developed solo, with precision and stealth. I share only what is sanitized or simulation-ready.”
